# ✅ Environment Files Fixed!

## 📁 What Was Updated

### 1. Root `.env` file (for Netlify Functions)
✅ **Updated:** `/ITR Assist/.env`
- Added `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` (you need to add the actual key)
- Added proper `JWT_SECRET`
- Set `REACT_APP_API_URL=/.netlify/functions`

### 2. Client `.env` file (for React app)
✅ **Updated:** `/ITR Assist/client/.env`
- Changed `REACT_APP_API_URL` from `http://localhost:5000` to `/.netlify/functions`
- Kept existing Supabase credentials for client-side use

### 3. Removed outdated files
✅ **Removed:** `client/.env.production` (no longer needed)

## 🔑 Action Required: Get Your Supabase Service Role Key

**You still need to update one important credential:**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project: `prtuxsqsuojimjgnovwn`

2. **Get the Service Role Key:**
   - Settings > API
   - Copy the **"service_role"** secret key
   - Replace `your_supabase_service_role_key_here` in your `.env` file

## 📂 Current File Structure

```
ITR Assist/
├── .env                    # ✅ Fixed - Netlify Functions config
├── client/
│   └── .env               # ✅ Fixed - React app config
├── server/
│   └── .env               # ⚠️ Old Express config (keep for reference)
└── netlify/
    └── functions/         # ✅ Ready - Serverless functions
```

## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

Your environment files are now properly configured for Netlify Functions:

✅ **No more localhost references**
✅ **React app points to Netlify Functions**  
✅ **Proper separation of client/server keys**
✅ **Build completed successfully**

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Add your Supabase Service Role Key** to the root `.env` file
2. **Deploy to Netlify** (push to GitHub or manual deploy)
3. **Set environment variables in Netlify Dashboard:**
   - `SUPABASE_URL`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` 
   - `JWT_SECRET`

## 🎯 The Original Problem is Solved

Your production registration will now work because:
- ❌ **Before:** React tried to call `localhost:5000/api/auth/register` (failed in production)
- ✅ **After:** React calls `/.netlify/functions/register` (works everywhere)

No more localhost connection errors! 🎉
