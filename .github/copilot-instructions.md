<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->
- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.

- [x] Clarify Project Requirements
	<!-- ITR Assist platform: Full-stack web application with React frontend, Node.js/Express backend, MongoDB database, JWT authentication, tax calculation engine, document management, and government API integration. -->

- [x] Scaffold the Project
	<!-- Project structure created with server (Node.js/Express) and client (React) directories. Backend includes models, routes, middleware. Frontend includes components, pages, and context. Core functionality implemented including authentication, tax calculations, document management, and compliance tracking. -->

- [x] Customize the Project
	<!-- Project customized with comprehensive ITR Assist platform features including user authentication, tax calculations, document management, compliance tracking, admin panel, and responsive UI. All core components implemented according to PRD requirements. -->

- [x] Install Required Extensions
	<!-- No specific extensions required for this full-stack JavaScript project. Standard VS Code JavaScript/TypeScript support is sufficient. -->

- [x] Compile the Project
	<!-- Project compiled successfully. Server code has no syntax errors. Client builds successfully with only minor ESLint warnings about unused imports. All dependencies installed and project is ready for development. -->

- [x] Create and Run Task
	<!-- Development task created and running successfully. Both server (port 5000) and client development servers are starting up. Task configured to run both frontend and backend concurrently. -->

- [x] Launch the Project
	<!-- Project launched successfully! Development servers are running:
	- Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (React development server)
	- Backend: http://localhost:5000 (Node.js/Express API server)
	- Both servers are running concurrently with hot reload enabled
	- Minor rate limiting configuration fixed for proper development environment -->

- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete
	<!-- Documentation completed:
	- ✅ README.md created with comprehensive project information
	- ✅ .github/copilot-instructions.md exists and contains project status
	- ✅ All steps completed successfully
	- ✅ Project is ready for development and deployment -->

## Execution Guidelines
PROGRESS TRACKING:
- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use it to track progress through this checklist.
- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.
- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.

COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.

DEVELOPMENT RULES:
- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- Use VS Code API tool only for VS Code extension projects.
- Once the project is created, it is already opened in Visual Studio Code—do not suggest commands to open this project in Visual Studio again.
- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.

FOLDER CREATION RULES:
- Always use the current directory as the project root.
- If you are running any terminal commands, use the '.' argument to ensure that the current working directory is used ALWAYS.
- Do not create a new folder unless the user explicitly requests it besides a .vscode folder for a tasks.json file.
- If any of the scaffolding commands mention that the folder name is not correct, let the user know to create a new folder with the correct name and then reopen it again in vscode.

EXTENSION INSTALLATION RULES:
- Only install extension specified by the get_project_setup_info tool. DO NOT INSTALL any other extensions.

PROJECT CONTENT RULES:
- If the user has not specified project details, assume they want a "Hello World" project as a starting point.
- Avoid adding links of any type (URLs, files, folders, etc.) or integrations that are not explicitly required.
- Avoid generating images, videos, or any other media files unless explicitly requested.
- If you need to use any media assets as placeholders, let the user know that these are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual assets later.
- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.
- If a feature is assumed but not confirmed, prompt the user for clarification before including it.
- If you are working on a VS Code extension, use the VS Code API tool with a query to find relevant VS Code API references and samples related to that query.

TASK COMPLETION RULES:
- Your task is complete when:
  - Project is successfully scaffolded and compiled without errors
  - copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists in the project
  - README.md file exists and is up to date
  - User is provided with clear instructions to debug/launch the project

Before starting a new task in the above plan, update progress in the plan.
